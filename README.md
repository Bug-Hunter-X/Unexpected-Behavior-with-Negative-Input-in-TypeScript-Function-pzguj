# Unexpected Behavior with Negative Input in TypeScript Function

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in a simple TypeScript function when provided with negative input.  The `printNumbers` function is intended to print numbers from 1 to `n`. However, when `n` is negative, it silently does nothing instead of throwing an error or providing an alternative output (like printing nothing or an error message).

The `bug.ts` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.ts` file provides a corrected version.
